"""Canonical trust-boundary classification for ADWF v1.6.

The classification is loaded only from trusted/default-branch code. A PR may
modify a copy of this module in its own head, but the trusted controller never
executes that copy when deciding whether the PR may be trusted.

This list is intentionally a conservative superset of the base trust policy.
Generated projections remain trust-boundary evidence here even though the PR
classifier may allow them to accompany normal docs/feature changes under R4.
